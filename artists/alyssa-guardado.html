      <h2>About the Artist</h2>
      <p>Born and raised in the vibrant Bay Area, Alyssa has always been surrounded by creativity and innovation. From
        an early age, she was drawn to the world of digital art, using it as a medium to express her thoughts, emotions,
        and experiences.

        Currently pursuing her Bachelor’s degree at San José State University, Alyssa is expected to graduate in
        December 2025. She remains dedicated to refining her artistic skills and expanding her creative horizons.
        Looking ahead, she plans to pursue a Master’s degree in Marketing to combine her artistic vision with strategic
        communication and brand development.</p>

      <p>“Fading Embrace” explores the bittersweet nature of clinging to something beautiful, even as it drains us. The
        skeletal hand grips a once-vibrant rose, slowly absorbing its beauty, leaving the petals pale and lifeless. This
        transformation symbolizes the pain of holding onto something that was never meant to last—something we cherish
        but that ultimately harms us.

        Inspired by Proverbs 3:5-6, “Trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding; in
        all your ways submit to Him, and He will make your paths straight,” this piece serves as a reminder that true
        peace comes from surrender. Holding on may feel safe, but sometimes, what we refuse to release is what keeps us
        from growing. The more we grip, the more we lose ourselves, until we are left as empty as the thing we tried to
        preserve.

        Through this work, I reflect on the necessity of letting go—not as a loss, but as a step toward transformation.
        Trusting God means believing that even after release, we will be restored. It is in surrender that we find
        renewal, and in faith that we discover beauty beyond what we once thought we needed.</p>
